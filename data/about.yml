    <strong>ABOUT DR. MARTENS</strong>
    The first pair of Dr. Martens boots rolled off the production line on the 1st April 1960. With its trademark yellow stitch, grooved sole and heel-loop, it was a boot for workers, initially worn by postmen and policemen; comfortable, durable and lightweight in comparison to its competitors at the time.
    Throughout Dr. Martens history, the brand has been adopted and subverted by diverse individuals, musicians, youth cultures and tribes. These are the people who stand out from the crowd and their journey of self-expression has always been accompanied by a pair of DM’s.
    The simple silhouette allows people to customize each pair; while on a utilitarian level their famous durability and comfort make them ideal footwear for the world of gigs and street fashion. On an emotional level, they are badge of attitude and empowerment.
    The Northamptonshire factory where it all began still exists to this day, in the village of Wollaston. A special range of ‘Made In England’ products are manufactured here by a small, close-knit team of people schooled in traditional shoe-making and the unique process that makes Dr. Martens like no other shoe on earth.
