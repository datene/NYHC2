“I’m really looking forward to this film, as a fan of the hardcore genre / culture in general, and of course the special New York hardcore faction we’re all part of, “Said Freddy Cricien (Madball). “I go way back with Drew Stone - he actually filmed Madball’s very first video, and I consider him a friend. He has the credibility, the experience and most importantly - the passion to deliver something super authentic, which for me and I’m sure for a lot of other folks, is most important of all!”<br>
Look for <strong>The New York Hardcore Chronicles Film</strong> out on the road this summer.<br> <br> <strong>“NYHC Forever and Always”</strong><br> <br> <strong>ABOUT DREW STONE</strong><br> <br> Drew Stone is an American film director, producer, writer, editor and musician. His works include music videos, commercials, documentary films and television. He founded New York City-based film production company Stone Films NYC and played an active role in the early stages of American hardcore.
www.stonefilmsnyc.com<br> <br> <strong>ABOUT DR. MARTENS</strong><br> <br> The first pair of Dr. Martens boots rolled off the production line on the 1st April 1960. With its trademark yellow stitch, grooved sole and heel-loop, it was a boot for workers, initially worn by postmen and policemen; comfortable, durable and lightweight in comparison to its competitors at the time. Throughout Dr. Martens history, the brand has been adopted and subverted by diverse individuals, musicians, youth cultures and tribes. These are the people who stand out from the crowd and their journey of self-expression has always been accompanied by a pair of DM’s. The simple silhouette allows people to customize each pair; while on a utilitarian level their famous durability and comfort make them ideal footwear for the world of gigs and street fashion. On an emotional level, they are badge of attitude and empowerment. The Northamptonshire factory where it all began still exists to this day, in the village of Wollaston. A special range of ‘Made In England’ products are manufactured here by a small, close-knit team of people schooled in traditional shoe-making and the unique process that makes Dr. Martens like no other shoe on earth.<br> <br> <strong>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION – Dr. Martens Related:</strong><br> Exposure USA | +1 212.226.2530
